        <h1>Brainstorming/ Wireframes</h1>
        <h3>
          I did some desk research about tailoring to get an overview of the
          audience and tested out already existing tailoring apps to grasp
          understanding of userflow first hand. To know what current service
          already offer and articulate on ways to improve my design to make the
          brand unique. I created various wireframe ideas based of design layout
          that was sartisfiying.

        <h1>Design review</h1>
        <h3>
          Feedback from testing expressed the design to be friendly to navigate
          with a few issue of too much click through. Reducing the amount of
          click through required was a struggle of finding balance between
          getting enough data for tailor to work with and having a pag of
          clustered questions. I probably could use a loop of nested dropdown to
          solve this issue .

        <img class="largeImg" src="Assets/Tailor Map2.png" />
        <h3>
          Overall the feeback from stake holders was positive, as they loved the
          simplicity of the design and how "it felt like instagram for tailors"
          which made it easy to relate and navigate.
